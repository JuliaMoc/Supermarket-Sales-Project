# Supermarket Sales Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes supermarket sales data from three supermarkets located in three different cities in Myanmar, using a dataset provided by Kaggle. The dataset spans a three-month period (January to March 2019) and contains valuable sales and customer data. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the creation of insightful visualizations using Python and Tableau.
The goal of this analysis is to derive insights from the data to help better understand sales performance across different supermarkets, cities, and product categories, as well as evaluate customer experience through ratings and performance trends by gender. This analysis aims to uncover the impact of customer satisfaction and demographics on sales, providing valuable insights into CRM strategies.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed in a Jupyter Notebook using **Python**, with libraries like **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.
- Key steps included handling duplicates, changing data types, splitting columns for more insight, renaming columns, and removing unnecessary columns.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to aggregate sales data and visualize trends, using bar charts, line charts, and heatmaps.

### 2. Data Visualization in Tableau
- The cleaned dataset was exported and visualized in **Tableau Public**.
- Key visualizations include dynamic KPI cards showing total sales, total quantity, and average customer ratings, as well as detailed heatmaps and category breakdowns.
- The user can filter the dashboard by month, city, and gender to explore various insights interactively.

### 3. Files Included
- **Kaggle CSV Dataset**: Original dataset from Kaggle.
- **Cleaned CSV Dataset**: Preprocessed and cleaned version of the dataset.
- **Tableau Visualization**: Supermarket Sales Analysis (Also available on Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julia.mochel/viz/SupermarketSalesAnalysis_17253664391580/SalesDashboard).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Python notebook containing all data preparation, analysis, and visualization code.

## Installation and Usage
### Requirements:
- **Python3**
